**Plan for Portfolio Update**

1. The portfolio should be one singular webpage
2. The portfolio should focus more on my profession as a project/program manager
3. Work done in the software development space should be shown as hobby/side work
4. The overall style should be more simplistic and professional
5. It should contain less pictures and graphics
6. The color should be that off blue found in the developer example explored earlier in my dev career.
7. Generate the new portfolio site on a separate github repo so that the old one can remain as a portfolio item
